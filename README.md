# CSCE315
A collection of all assignments from TAMU CSCE 315 Spring 2022.

This is a running list as I am currently enrolled in the class.

This is simply a showcase of my work to be used as solid reference for potential employers. If you are presently a student at Texas A&M University, I expressly forbid usage of my code for purposes violating the Aggie Honor Code.

"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.

The Aggie Code of Honor is an effort to unify the aims of all Texas A&M men and women toward a high code of ethics and personal dignity. For most, living under this code will be no problem, as it asks nothing of a person that is beyond reason. It only calls for honesty and integrity, characteristics that Aggies have always exemplified.

The Aggie Code of Honor functions as a symbol to all Aggies, promoting understanding and loyalty to truth and confidence in each other."
